Your questions here.

(would change to a markdown if gradescope would allow it, so i'm just writing
in markdown notation anyways)

1. Why does every class need to have it's own file? At least, why does it not
   give the user freedom of choice with file organization

2. Why is this content in the braces not connected to an actual process? It's 
   kinda just...there?
    ```
        public List<Medicine> goods;

        {
            goods = new ArrayList<Medicine>();
        }
    ```

3. Why are the .java files so nested? What is the benefit of doing 
   `/home/ihage/projects/medava/src/main/java/edu/uc/cs3003/medava/Hospital.java`
